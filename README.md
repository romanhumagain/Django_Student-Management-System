<h1>Student Management System</h1>

<p>This repository contains the code for a robust Student Management System, developed using the Django framework. The main goal of this system is to simplify and automate various aspects of student information management in educational institutions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Student Information Management:</b> The system offers a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of student information. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Enrollment: Keep track of student enrollments in different courses or programs.</li>
      <li>Attendance: Record and monitor student attendance for different classes or sessions.</li>
      <li>Grades: Manage student grades for assignments, tests, and exams.</li>
      <li>Assignments: Track assignment submissions and deadlines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Automated Attendance Notifications:</b> A unique feature of this system is the automated notification mechanism. If a student is marked as absent, the system immediately sends an email to the student informing them of their absence.</li>

  <li><b>Email Verification:</b> To ensure the authenticity of the users, our system incorporates an email verification mechanism during the account creation process. When a new student verify there account, a verification link is sent to their registered email address. By clicking on this link, the student confirms the validity of their email address, and their account is activated.</li>

  <li><b>Notice Board:</b> This system also includes a digital notice board feature. This allows administrators to post important announcements or updates. Students can check this notice board to stay informed about upcoming events, changes to the schedule, or other pertinent information.</li>
